# DataStructures-Algorithm
Data is actually the value and algorithm is the logic or relation for storing the data
Data strucure is an efficient way of storing the data so that they can be used effectively
Data structures are classified as Primitive and non primitive
Primitive>Define.Intg ,Boolean,Char
Non Primitive>
    Linear       NonLinear
Algorithm:Computed procedure ha take input and produce output
An Algorithm is said to be correct if we get the correct output
    
Imp of Algorithm
  >Time
  >Rescources(Storage)
  >Efficency
  >Shortest Pathh

Code:Code is actually a set of rules that we give the computer to perform a particular task

>C++ is a progimming language which is object oriented
>Powerful and fast
>Platform dependent
>simple
>Memory Management
